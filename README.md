# Crystal Collector Game

## Overview 

* There will be four figures displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a figure, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
* Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
* When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
* The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
